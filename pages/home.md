Hi! I started learning to code around 2012 and now work as a software engineer, doing mostly devops. I love working on hobby coding projects in my free time. Some of my favorites have focused on generative art, web & iOS app development, and command line tools and games.

Besides coding, I enjoy running, hiking, playing tennis, swing dancing, and generally staying active! I follow a plant-based lifestyle and love cooking, baking, and trying out new restaurants!
