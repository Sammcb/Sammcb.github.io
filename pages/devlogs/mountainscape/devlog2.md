## Color Me Impressed

After the last devlog, all I needed to do to finish up an initial version of the mountain scape generator was to tweak the generation parameters and add a coloring system. I looked at some vector art and loved the look of a bluish haze over the layers of mountains. I wanted to make a flexible system that would allow me to choose between using solid colors or gradients.

```javascript
// mountains.js
if (gradient) {
	const gradient = context.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 0, height)
	gradient.addColorStop(0, colors[0])
	gradient.addColorStop(1, colors[1])
	context.fillStyle = gradient
} else {
	context.fillStyle = colors[0]
}
```

After adding adding this, I spent a little time tweaking generation parameters and color values and ended up with some pretty nice views ‚õ∞üèî!
