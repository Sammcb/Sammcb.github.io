## About

Hi, I'm Sam McBroom! I use he/him pronouns.

I started learning to code around 2012 and now work as a software engineer, doing mostly devops. My work involves operating core Kubernetes services, including observability systems, ingress networking, and autoscaling operators.

I love working on hobby projects in my free time. Some of my favorite projects have focused on generative art, web & SwiftUI app development, command line tools and games, and operating services in a homelab Kubernetes cluster. I sometimes write up devlog/blog posts about my projects. Generally, I love learning about new things, especially related to computer science, physics, and math.

Besides coding, I enjoy walking, hiking, casually playing most sports, and being outside. I am vegan, and I love cooking, baking, and trying out new restaurants. I also like painting with watercolor or making digital art. I love animals, especially dogs!

I do not use any AI or LLMs for my hobby coding projects, art, or writing.

🌎 I believe the world is a better place when we treat animals, the planet, and each other with respect. Everyone should have the right to clean air and water, healthy food, housing, privacy, safety, love, and identity expression. ❤️
